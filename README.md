# From Code To Mockup


# Techdegree F.E.W.D. Slack Challenge Project 03

**These projects are not required to complete your Treehouse Techdegree. They are a supplement to your learning and can be great additions to your portfolio as full projects.**

## **Description** - 
`You're working for a company as a front-end developer. Your boss tells you that your team is putting the finishing touches on a website they've been developing; Momentum. The design team has created a mockup for the beta testing landing page for this website and your boss needs you to code it out with just HTML and CSS!`

## **Getting Started**
When downloading this project, you'll recieve a folder called `Momentume`. Inside this folder you'll find a few files. (a CSS folder with a stylesheet, an images folder, a mockups folder and an index.html file) - Open up the mockups folder and you'll see the mockup the design team has created for you. The goal is for you to write all the HTML and CSS to execute the mockup as closely as you can. All the images and icons you will need are included in the images folder. In the HTML file you'll see the structure for this project already coded out. You just need to finish it. Should you get stuck, feel free to reach out and ask for some assistance.
